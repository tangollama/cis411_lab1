# CIS 411 Lab 2: Architecture Selection
This is the Requirements Lab for CIS 411: Systems Analysis and Design for [Messiah University](http://messiah.edu)

The purpose of this lab is to engage students in the considering the purpose, value, and unique differentiation of system architectural patterns.

# Doing the Lab

## 1. Pre-Requisites
1. GitHub account
2. Git is installed on your development machine.
3. Text editor or other integrated development environment (IDE) for modifying code.

## 2. Lab Description
> Software Architecture: A sufficiently detailed design plan / blueprint (often expressed in working code / prototype / demo) for an end-to-end software / technology solution to a business problem that contains some ultimate human benefit/impact.
Software Architects have to where a number of different hats.  They must have
1. a command of the business domain, 
2. a design-sense for solutions that humans can use, 
3. the technical chops to understand what platforms and products to use, and
4. practical knowledge on how to deliver software.

In this lab, you are going to review a proposed architecture for an application called **Serve Central**.  They have proposed a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, and you are going to do the first round of analysis on their proposal by documenting use cases and identifying the architectural components.  

Fortunately, the team has done a fantastic job, so you will be asked to reassess your designs for two different business opportunities.

Detailed instructions are [here](LAB_INSTRUCTIONS.md), and you are expected to compile your findings into a labreport following this [template](labreports/LAB_TEMPLATE.md).

## 3. Submissions
You are expected to create a lab report as a markdown file under the labreports directory using the **LAB_[GITHUB Handle].md** naming convention in your forked repository.  After you have reviewed your work, then you should submit a `Pull Request` to this repository with your lab report and any accompanying images/files (e.g., required diagrams).  Add the `Pull Request` URL into the courseroom LMS (Canvas) for grading.
