# Step 0: Reviewing Architectural Patterns
See the [lecture / discussion](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nUcy63FWPFYO3OJmERJpMjEtdaFtaIBbuUkpmNRVRas/edit#slide=id.g45345bd5ea_0_136) from CIS 411. You'll need to be familiar with the content from this lecture to complete this assignment.

Note: you are free to work with classmates on this assignment. _Good architecture is born out of collaboration - not reclusive mad-scientist behavior._ However, if you work with colleagues:

1. You must specifically note your collaborators by name at the top of your report.
2. You may not completely copy each others work (diagrams and descriptions, even if your solutions are identical).

# Step 1: MVC Architecture
Review the proposals for the Serve Central project. Let's imagine that the project has been granted (relatively) unlimited resources if they can deliver a version 1 release in 120 days. As a result, the team decides to implement an MVC architecture for its version 1 release, delivering functionality through a [responsive web application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design). 

Based on the [this](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UnU0xU0wF1l8pAB8trtLpdM0yuskx66jTFJzd64nsjU/edit#slide=id.g439b9c6866_2_53) and [this](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-VZfAFoBVr6ijNepKAtRA7JoAQsV2Jlbf2l1WPDMhI0/edit) presentation:

1) Document two use cases of your choosing


| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Send mass email to volunteer base |
| Description / Steps | An Organization sets up charity and service events. The system enables the Organization to send emails to previous volunteers with information about the new event. |
| Primary Actor | For the Homeless Org. |
| Pre-Conditions: | 1. The Organization has set up the event in the system<br>2. The Organization has selected some or all of their volunteer base which is saved in the system |
| Post-Conditions: | 1. The system sends a mass email to specified volunteers |


| Use Case #2 | |
|---|---|
| Title | Find relevant service opportunities |
| Description / Steps | A volunteer in the system searches for service oppotunities in the area. The system responds by going through events registered by organizations and listing them for the user. |
| Primary Actor | A volunteer |
| Pre-Conditions:| 1. The volunteer has personal information stored in the system<br>2. The volunteer has specified a location and range to search for service opportunities<br>3. Organizations have registered events with the system |
| Post-Conditions: | 1. The system displays search results based on user specified locations |


2) Highlight a [table](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) of at least **four models, views, and controllers** needed to produce this project.


| Model | View | Controller |
|---|---|---|
| Volunteers | Login Screen | Registering a User |
| Contact Information | User Info Page | Updating User Information |
| Organizations | Organization Info Page | Updating Oranization Info |
| Events | Event Info Page | Creating an Event |
| Locations | Map View Page | Signing up for an event |


3) Generate and [embed](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images) at least one diagram of the interaction between an Actor from the Use Cases, and one set of Model(s), View(s), and Controller(s) from the proposed architecture, including all the related / necessary services (ex: data storage and retrieval, web servers, container tech, etc.)

_Note: You are free to use any diagraming tool and framework that you want as long as it clearly communicates the concept. I typically use a UML System Use Case or [UML Sequence Diagram](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/index-examples.html).  If you do not have a preferred diagramming tool: [draw.io](http://draw.io) or [lucidchart](http://lucidchart.com) are good cloud-based options._

# Step 2: Enhancing an Architecture
After an initial release and a few months of operation, Serve Central encounters a tremendous growth opportunity to extend their service and provide a volunteer recuitment and management interface to __four__ of the primary volunteer entities in the United States. As such, a reevaluation of the architecture is required, one that allows:

1. Thirdparty services to both input and retrieve data from the Serve Central model/datastore. (For instance, receiving volunteer opportunities from United Way chapters across the country.)
2. Building organization-specific interfaces on top of the Serve Central business and data logic. (For instance, allowing the registration services of Serve Central to be embedded in the website of local churches, [ah-la Stripe embedding](https://stripe.com/payments/elements).)

To support these objectives:
1. What architectural patterns (either of those presented in class on based on your own research) are appropriate? Justify your response, highlighting your presumed benefits / capabilties of your chosen architecture(s) **as well as as least one potential issue / adverse consequence** of your choice.
2. Using your preferred diagramming tool, generate a diagram of the new Serve Central architecture that supports these two new requirements.


To support these objectives, the architectural pattern I believe is appropriate is a Layered Architecture. Within a layered architecture, Serve Central can separate their processes and make them as complex as needed to support their growth while still maintaining relatively simple intereaction between the layers. Third-party services will be able to input and output data with Serve Central's database by going through the layers. Interfaces can be built off existing layers, allowing other organizations to embed Serve Central's code into their own structure. The downside to this approach is the independence of the layers, that if an error occurs in one layer, it can potentially cascade errors throughout the others since they rely on eachother.

# Step 3: Scaling an Architecture
18 months into the future, Serve Central is experiencing profound growth in the use of the service with more than 100k daily, active users and nearly 1M event registrations per month. As a result, the [Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/) has funded a project to build and launch a mobile application aimed at encouraging peer-to-peer volunteer opportunity promotion and organization. 

In addition to building a new mobile application interface, the grant requires that the project prepare for the following future needs:

1. Consuming bursts of 10k+ new volunteer opportunities per hour with a latency of less than 15 seconds between submitting an opportunity and it's availability in the registration service.
2. Supporting a volunteer and event data store that will quickly exceed 50TB of data
3. Allowing authorized parties to issue queries that traverse the TB's of data stored in your datastore(s).
4. Enabling researchers to examine patterns of volunteer opportunities as a way of determining future grant investments.

What archictural pattern(s) will you employ to support each of these needs? What will the benefits and consequences be? Why are changes needed at all? Justify your answers.

To support these needs, I believe the Master-Slave Architecture is the best choice. For as much traffic and space the website will need to host, having multiple slaves to perform queries will greatly speed up the process. Each can take on a different task while having access to all the same information from the master. Transactions can then happen simultaneously, allowing for more exchanges of information and consequently less time taken. This change is important because the Layered Architecture no longer has the computing or server power to handle all the requests being thrown at it. Having multiple slave servers will handle hundreds of thousands of transactions much more easily. A possible downside to this architecture is information being miscommunicated or being communicated more than once. More than one slave may ouch the saem information back to the master, or the master may need information that hasn't been pushed yet from a slave.

# Extra Credit
1. Create and embed a comprehensive diagram of your final architecture (i.e. one that meets all the requirements of this lab, including Step 3).
2. Augment/improve the assignment. Suggest meaningful changes in the assignment and highlight those changes in the extra credit portion of your lab report.
