# Step 0: Reviewing Architectural Patterns
See the [lecture / discussion](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nUcy63FWPFYO3OJmERJpMjEtdaFtaIBbuUkpmNRVRas/edit#slide=id.g45345bd5ea_0_136) from CIS 411. You'll need to be familiar with the content from this lecture to complete this assignment.

Note: you are free to work with classmates on this assignment. _Good architecture is born out of collaboration - not reclusive mad-scientist behavior._ However, if you work with colleagues:

1. You must specifically note your collaborators by name at the top of your report.
2. You may not completely copy each others work (diagrams and descriptions, even if your solutions are identical).

# Step 1: MVC Architecture
Review the proposals for the Serve Central project. Let's imagine that the project has been granted (relatively) unlimited resources if they can deliver a version 1 release in 120 days. As a result, the team decides to implement an MVC architecture for its version 1 release, delivering functionality through a [responsive web application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design). 

Based on the [this](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UnU0xU0wF1l8pAB8trtLpdM0yuskx66jTFJzd64nsjU/edit#slide=id.g439b9c6866_2_53) and [this](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-VZfAFoBVr6ijNepKAtRA7JoAQsV2Jlbf2l1WPDMhI0/edit) presentation:

1) Document two use cases of your choosing

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | User can create a profile |
| Description / Steps | A user can sign up for a profile by putting in their email and password that they will use to sign in to their profile. |
| Primary Actor | User |
| Preconditions | User does not already have a profile |
| Postconditions | User has a profile that can be accessed |

| Use Case #2 | |
|---|---|
| Title | User can search for nearby events |
| Description / Steps | When the user is signed into their profile they have the option of searching for nearby events that they have the option to volunteer for. |
| Primary Actor | User |
| Preconditions | The user is signed into their account and on the main page |
| Postconditions | The user will find different events based on the area they are searching and will have options to choose from. |


2) Highlight a [table](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) of at least **four models, views, and controllers** needed to produce this project.

| Model | View | Controller |
|---|---|---|
| User Class  | Account Information Page | User Controller |
| Event Class | Event Page | Event Controller |
| Location Class | Map | Location Controller |
| Sponsor Class | Sponsor View | Sponsor Controller |

3) Generate and [embed](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images) at least one diagram of the interaction between an Actor from the Use Cases, and one set of Model(s), View(s), and Controller(s) from the proposed architecture, including all the related / necessary services (ex: data storage and retrieval, web servers, container tech, etc.)

_Note: You are free to use any diagraming tool and framework that you want as long as it clearly communicates the concept. I typically use a UML System Use Case or [UML Sequence Diagram](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/index-examples.html).  If you do not have a preferred diagramming tool: [draw.io](http://draw.io) or [lucidchart](http://lucidchart.com) are good cloud-based options._

# Step 2: Enhancing an Architecture
After an initial release and a few months of operation, Serve Central encounters a tremendous growth opportunity to extend their service and provide a volunteer recuitment and management interface to __four__ of the primary volunteer entities in the United States. As such, a reevaluation of the architecture is required, one that allows:

1. Thirdparty services to both input and retrieve data from the Serve Central model/datastore. (For instance, receiving volunteer opportunities from United Way chapters across the country.)
2. Building organization-specific interfaces on top of the Serve Central business and data logic. (For instance, allowing the registration services of Serve Central to be embedded in the website of local churches, [ah-la Stripe embedding](https://stripe.com/payments/elements).)

To support these objectives:
1. What architectural patterns (either of those presented in class on based on your own research) are appropriate? Justify your response, highlighting your presumed benefits / capabilties of your chosen architecture(s) **as well as as least one potential issue / adverse consequence** of your choice.

I think the most appropriate pattern architecturaly would be layered. This would make it so that there were a lot of different options going forward as far as events and the locations of those events. It would also make it easier for users to retrieve the information they need to retrieve with less frustration.

2. Using your preferred diagramming tool, generate a diagram of the new Serve Central architecture that supports these two new requirements.

# Step 3: Scaling an Architecture
18 months into the future, Serve Central is experiencing profound growth in the use of the service with more than 100k daily, active users and nearly 1M event registrations per month. As a result, the [Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/) has funded a project to build and launch a mobile application aimed at encouraging peer-to-peer volunteer opportunity promotion and organization. 

In addition to building a new mobile application interface, the grant requires that the project prepare for the following future needs:

1. Consuming bursts of 10k+ new volunteer opportunities per hour with a latency of less than 15 seconds between submitting an opportunity and it's availability in the registration service.
2. Supporting a volunteer and event data store that will quickly exceed 50TB of data
3. Allowing authorized parties to issue queries that traverse the TB's of data stored in your datastore(s).
4. Enabling researchers to examine patterns of volunteer opportunities as a way of determining future grant investments.

What archictural pattern(s) will you employee to support each of these needs? What will the benefits and consequences be? Why are changes needed at all? Justify your answers.

I would stick with a layered architecture and make it more layered. I do not think that a layered architecture will be limited when you can add more layers and still implement a database that would allow for researches to examine patterns of volunteer opportunities as a way of determining future grant investments. 0

# Extra Credit
1. Create and embed a comprehensive diagram of your final architecture (i.e. one that meets all the requirements of this lab, including Step 3).
2. Augment/improve the assignment. Suggest meaningful changes in the assignment and highlight those changes in the extra credit portion of your lab report.
